# Adding Spatial Information

# Goal

This example demonstrates how spatial information can be integrated
into an agent-based model using Vahana. While Vahana's primary focus
is on graph-based simulations, it support the inclusion of spatial
information into models.  It allows you to define a spatial grid,
associate agents with specific locations, and implement interactions
based on spatial proximity, even though the underlying implementation
still operates on graph structures.

It's worth noting that in its current version, Vahana may not be the
optimal choice for models that primarily depend on frequent movement
of agents across space. However, as this example will show, it is
entirely possible to implement those models.

It allows you to define a spatial grid, associate agents with specific
locations, and implement interactions based on spatial proximity, all
while leveraging Vahana's efficient graph-based computations.

For the understanding of how Vahana handles spatial information and
rasters, you may find it helpful to watch also the [corresponding
section of the Vahana.jl Juliacon
video](https://youtu.be/-318ec-kCBM?si=YNnWLrb-_7RPSEPB&t=1198). The
video provides a visual explanation of how rasters are implemented
within Vahana's graph-based framework and demonstrates some key
concepts that we'll be applying in this tutorial.

In this tutorial, we'll implement a predator-prey model with spatial
components, showcasing how Vahana's raster functionality can be used
to create a spatially-explicit ecological simulation.

The model is based on the [Predator-Prey for High-Performance
Computing](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-36/) (PPHPC) model. In
PPHPC the agents move randomly, in our implementation the prey move
to locations with grass (if one is in sight) and the predators move to
locations with prey to demonstrate how features like this can be
implemented in Vahana.

# Agent and Edge Types

````@example predator
using CairoMakie, Vahana, Random

Random.seed!(1); #hide
detect_stateless(true) #hide
````

In our spatial predator-prey model, we define separate structures for
predators and prey, even though they share the same fields:

````@example predator
struct Predator
    energy::Int64
    pos::CartesianIndex{2}
end

struct Prey
    energy::Int64
    pos::CartesianIndex{2}
end
````

Despite their identical structure, we define them as separate types
because Vahana uses these types as tags for differentiating between
agent categories.

In the following sections, we'll use "Species" as an umbrella term to
refer to both Predator and Prey. Functions that are applicable to both
types will take the type as a parameter, which we'll denote as Species
in the function arguments.

Aside from the predator and prey agents, the spatial environment is
represented by grid cells, which are also implemented as agents and
consequently function as nodes within the graph structure.

````@example predator
struct Cell
    pos::CartesianIndex{2}
    countdown::Int64
end
````

All agents maintain their position as part of their internal
state. However, a cell can only perceive the animals if they are
directly connected to the cell through an edge. Vahana facilitates the
establishment of such edges via the [`move_to!`](@ref) function.

Edges represent connections from prey or predators to cells. We define
Position as a parametric type, enabling cells to distinguish between
prey and predators based on the type of the edges.

````@example predator
struct Position{T} end
````

Views are also edges from the cells to the prey and predators
respectively. These edges represent the cells that are visible to a
prey or predator so that, for example, it is possible to check which
cell in the visible area contains food.

````@example predator
struct View{T} end
````

VisiblePrey edges represent connections from prey to
predator. Currently, all edge types link animals to cells, and without
an incoming edge from prey, a predator lacks awareness of prey
positions. The VisiblePrey edges are generated by cells through the
`find_prey` transition function, as cells possess knowledge of which Prey
entities are directly located on the cell via the Position{Prey} edges,
and consequently within the view of a predator via the View{Predator}
edges.

````@example predator
struct VisiblePrey end
````

The last two edge types are messages to inform the agents that they
must die or find something to eat.

````@example predator
struct Die end

struct Eat end
````

# Params and Globals

We follow the parameter structure from the PPHPC model, but use
(besides the initial population) the same parameters for Prey and Predator
for the example run.

````@example predator
Base.@kwdef mutable struct SpeciesParams
    init_population::Int64 = 500
    gain_from_food::Int64 = 5
    loss_per_turn::Int64 = 1
    repro_thres::Int64 = 5
    repro_prob::Int64 = 20
end

Base.@kwdef struct AllParams
    raster_size::Tuple{Int64, Int64} = (100, 100)
    restart::Int64 = 5
    predator::SpeciesParams = SpeciesParams()
    prey::SpeciesParams = SpeciesParams()
end;

params = AllParams()
params.prey.init_population = 2000;
nothing #hide
````

We are creating timeseries (in the form of `Vector`s) for the predator
and prey population, the number of cells with food, and the average
energy of the predators and prey.

````@example predator
Base.@kwdef mutable struct PPGlobals
    predator_pop = Vector{Int64}()
    prey_pop = Vector{Int64}()
    cells_with_food = Vector{Int64}()
    mean_predator_energy = Vector{Float64}()
    mean_prey_energy = Vector{Float64}()
end;
nothing #hide
````

## Create the Simulation

We have now defined all the Julia structs needed to create the model
and a simulation.

````@example predator
const ppsim = ModelTypes() |>
    register_agenttype!(Predator) |>
    register_agenttype!(Prey) |>
    register_agenttype!(Cell) |>
    register_edgetype!(Position{Predator}) |>
    register_edgetype!(Position{Prey}) |>
    register_edgetype!(View{Predator}) |>
    register_edgetype!(View{Prey}) |>
    register_edgetype!(VisiblePrey) |>
    register_edgetype!(Die) |>
    register_edgetype!(Eat) |>
    create_model("Predator Prey") |>
    create_simulation(params, PPGlobals())
````

## Initialization

First we add the Cells to the Simulation. Therefore we define a
constructor function for the cells. There is a 50% probability that a cell
contains food (and in this case `countdown` is 0).

````@example predator
init_cell(pos::CartesianIndex) =
    Cell(pos, rand() < 0.5 ? 0 : rand(1:param(ppsim, :restart)))

add_raster!(ppsim, :raster, param(ppsim, :raster_size), init_cell);
nothing #hide
````

We define a auxiliary functions to facilitate the relocation of an
agent to a new position. These functions will add a single `Position`
edge from the animal to the cell at the `newpos` position, and for all
cells within a Manhattan distance of 1, `View` edges will be
established from those cells to and from the animal, as well as to the
cell itself.

````@example predator
function move!(sim, id, newpos, Species)
    move_to!(sim, :raster, id, newpos, nothing, Position{Species}())
    move_to!(sim, :raster, id, newpos, View{Species}(), View{Species}();
             distance = 1, metric = :manhatten)
end;
nothing #hide
````

The add_animals function is a generic initializer for both predators and
prey, taking species-specific parameters and the species type as
arguments. It creates a specified number of agents, each with a
random position on the raster and a random initial energy within a
defined range, then adds them to the simulation and places them on
the raster using the move! function.

````@example predator
function add_animals(params, Species)
    energyrange = 1:(2*params.gain_from_food)
    foreach(1:params.init_population) do _
        pos = random_pos(ppsim, :raster)
        id = add_agent!(ppsim, Species(rand(energyrange), pos))
        move!(ppsim, id, pos, Species)
    end
end

add_animals(param(ppsim, :prey), Prey)
add_animals(param(ppsim, :predator), Predator)
````

At the end of the initialization phase we have to call finish_init!

````@example predator
finish_init!(ppsim)
````

## Transition Functions

As mentioned in the comment for the View type, the cells are
responsible for connecting the Prey with the Predators. So each cell
iterate over each prey on the cell and add edges to all predators
that can view the cell.

The underscore (_) as the first argument in the find_prey function signifies
that we don't need to access the state of the cell itself. This is
because the function only needs to check for the presence of edges and create
new connections based on those edges, without using any information from
the cell's internal state. As a result, when we call apply! for
find_prey, we don't include Cell in the read argument. Consequently,
Vahana passes Val(Cell) as the first argument to find_prey for multiple
dispatch purposes, rather than the actual cell state. This approach
optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary data access and allows
the function to operate solely on the graph structure of the simulation.

````@example predator
function find_prey(_::Val{Cell}, id, sim)
    if has_edge(sim, id, Position{Prey}) && has_edge(sim, id, View{Predator})
        for preyid in neighborids(sim, id, Position{Prey})
            for predid in neighborids(sim, id, View{Predator})
                add_edge!(sim, preyid, predid, VisiblePrey())
            end
        end
    end
end;
nothing #hide
````

If a predator has enough energy left to move and there is a prey in the
predator's field of view, a random prey is selected and its position
is used as the new position. If no prey is visible, a random cell in
the predator's field of view is selected as the new position.

If there is not enough energy left, the transition function returns `nothing`,
which means that the predator dies and is no longer part of the graph.

````@example predator
function move(state::Predator, id, sim)
    e = state.energy - param(sim, :predator).loss_per_turn
    if e > 0
        # we need to access the pos of the prey which is part of it's state
        prey = neighborstates(sim, id, VisiblePrey, Prey)
        newpos = if isnothing(prey)
            nextcellid = rand(neighborids(sim, id, View{Predator}))
            agentstate(sim, nextcellid, Cell).pos
        else
            rand(prey).pos
        end
        move!(sim, id, newpos, Predator)
        Predator(e, newpos)
    else
        nothing
    end
end;
nothing #hide
````

The movement logic for prey differs from that of predators in terms of
their target. While predators seek cells containing prey, prey agents
search for cells with available grass. In our implementation of the
PPHPC (Predator-Prey for High-Performance Computing) model, grass
availability is indicated by the countdown field of a
cell. Specifically, grass is considered available for consumption when a
cell's countdown value equals 0.

````@example predator
function move(state::Prey, id, sim)
    e = state.energy - param(sim, :prey).loss_per_turn
    if e > 0
        withgrass = filter(neighborids(sim, id, View{Prey})) do id
            agentstate(sim, id, Cell).countdown == 0
        end
        nextcellid = if length(withgrass) == 0
            rand(neighborids(sim, id, View{Prey}))
        else
            rand(withgrass)
        end
        newpos = agentstate(sim, nextcellid, Cell).pos
        move!(sim, id, newpos, Prey)
        Prey(e, newpos)
    else
        nothing
    end
end;
nothing #hide
````

If a cell has no grass and the countdown field is therefore > 0, the
countdown is decreased by 1.

````@example predator
function grow_food(state::Cell, _, _)
    Cell(state.pos, max(state.countdown - 1, 0))
end;
nothing #hide
````

The try_eat transition function simulates the predator-prey interactions and
feeding processes within each cell. When both predators and prey
occupy the same cell, the function generates random predator-prey pairings,
ensuring each prey is targeted at most once and each predator consumes
no more than one prey. These interactions are represented by creating
Die edges from the cell to the consumed prey and Eat edges from the
cell to the successful predators. If any prey survive this process and
the cell contains available grass (indicated by a countdown of 0), an
Eat edge is established between the cell and a randomly selected
surviving prey, simulating grazing behavior.

````@example predator
function try_eat(state::Cell, id, sim)
    predators = neighborids(sim, id, Position{Predator})
    prey = neighborids(sim, id, Position{Prey})

    # first the predators eat the prey, in case that both are on the cell
    if ! isnothing(predators) && ! isnothing(prey)
        prey = Set(prey)
        for pred in shuffle(predators)
            if length(prey) > 0
                p = rand(prey)
                add_edge!(sim, id, p, Die())
                add_edge!(sim, id, pred, Eat())
                delete!(prey, p)
            end
        end
    end

    # then check if there is prey left that can eat the grass
    if  ! isnothing(prey) && length(prey) > 0 && state.countdown == 0
        add_edge!(sim, id, rand(prey), Eat())
        Cell(state.pos, param(sim, :restart))
    else
        state
    end
end;
nothing #hide
````

The reproduction mechanism for both predators and prey follows a similar
pattern, allowing us to define a generic function applicable to both
species. This function first determines if the animal found something to eat
by checking for the presence of an Eat edge targeting the animal, a
result of previous transition functions. If such an edge exists, the
animal's energy increases.

The function then evaluates if the animal's energy
exceeds a specified threshold parameter. When this condition is met,
reproduction occurs: a new offspring is introduced to the simulation
via the add_agent call, inheriting half of its parent's energy, and is
positioned at the same location as its parent using the move! function.

````@example predator
function try_reproduce_imp(state, id, sim, species_params, Species)
    if has_edge(sim, id, Eat)
        state = Species(state.energy + species_params.gain_from_food, state.pos)
    end
    if state.energy > species_params.repro_thres &&
        rand() * 100 < species_params.repro_prob

        energy_offspring = Int64(round(state.energy / 2))
        newid = add_agent!(sim, Species(energy_offspring, state.pos))
        move!(sim, newid, state.pos, Species)
        Species(state.energy - energy_offspring, state.pos)
    else
        state
    end
end;
nothing #hide
````

For the Predator we can just call the reproduce function with the necessary
arguments.

````@example predator
try_reproduce(state::Predator, id, sim) =
    try_reproduce_imp(state, id, sim, param(sim, :predator), Predator)
````

The prey animal needs an extra step because it might have been eaten
by a predator. So, we check if there is a `Die` edge leading to the
prey animal, and if so, the prey animal is removed from the
simulation (by returning nothing). Otherwise, we again just call the
reproduce function defined above.

````@example predator
function try_reproduce(state::Prey, id, sim)
    if has_edge(sim, id, Die)
        return nothing
    end
    try_reproduce_imp(state, id, sim, param(sim, :prey), Prey)
end;
nothing #hide
````

We update the global values and use the `mapreduce` method to count
the population and the number of cells with food. Based on the
values, we can then also calculate the mean energy values.

````@example predator
function update_globals(sim)
    push_global!(sim, :predator_pop, mapreduce(sim, _ -> 1, +, Predator; init = 0))
    push_global!(sim, :prey_pop, mapreduce(sim, _ -> 1, +, Prey; init = 0))
    push_global!(sim, :cells_with_food,
                mapreduce(sim, c -> c.countdown == 0, +, Cell))
    push_global!(sim, :mean_predator_energy,
                mapreduce(sim, p -> p.energy, +, Predator; init = 0) /
                    last(get_global(sim, :predator_pop)))
    push_global!(sim, :mean_prey_energy,
                mapreduce(sim, p -> p.energy, +, Prey; init = 0) /
                    last(get_global(sim, :prey_pop)))
end;
nothing #hide
````

We add to our time series also the values after the initialization.

````@example predator
update_globals(ppsim);
nothing #hide
````

And finally we define in which order our transitions functions are called.
Worth mentioning here are the keyword arguments in `find_prey` and
`try_reproduce`.

The add_existing keyword in the try_reproduce transition function signify that
the currently existing position and view edges should not be
removed, and only additional edges should be added, in our case the
position of the potential offspring.

````@example predator
function step!(sim)
    apply!(sim, move,
           [ Prey ],
           [ Prey, View{Prey}, Cell ],
           [ Prey, View{Prey}, Position{Prey} ])

    apply!(sim, find_prey,
           [ Cell ],
           [ Position{Prey}, View{Predator} ],
           [ VisiblePrey ])

    apply!(sim, move,
           [ Predator ],
           [ Predator, View{Predator}, Cell, Prey, VisiblePrey ],
           [ Predator, View{Predator}, Position{Predator} ])

    apply!(sim, grow_food, Cell, Cell, Cell)

    apply!(sim, try_eat,
           [ Cell ],
           [ Cell, Position{Predator}, Position{Prey} ],
           [ Cell, Die, Eat ])

    apply!(sim, try_reproduce,
           [ Predator, Prey ],
           [ Predator, Prey, Die, Eat ],
           [ Predator, Prey, Position{Predator}, Position{Prey},
             View{Predator}, View{Prey} ];
           add_existing = [ Position{Predator}, Position{Prey},
                            View{Predator}, View{Prey} ])

    update_globals(sim)
end;
nothing #hide
````

Now we can run the simulation

````@example predator
for _ in 1:400 step!(ppsim) end
````

## Plots

To visualize the results we use the Makie package.

### Time series

First, we will generate a line chart for the time series data stored in
the global state. Vahana provides the `plot_globals` function for this
purpose. This function not only returns the Makie Figure itself but also the
Axis and Plots, allowing for further processing of the result. If you
wish to display the default result, you can utilize the Julia `first`
function to extract the figure from the returned tuple.

````@example predator
plot_globals(ppsim, [ :predator_pop, :prey_pop, :cells_with_food ]) |> first
````

### Spatial distribution

To visualize the spatial information we can use `heatmap` in
combination with the Vahana's `calc_raster` function. E.g. the
number of Position{Prey} edges connected to a cell give us the
number of Prey individuals currently on that cell.

It would be nice to have a colorbar for the heatmaps so we define a small
helper function that can be used in a pipe.

````@example predator
function add_colorbar(hm)
    Makie.Colorbar(hm.figure[:,2], hm.plot)
    hm
end;
nothing #hide
````

#### Predators Positions

````@example predator
calc_raster(ppsim, :raster, Int64, [ Position{Predator} ]) do id
    num_edges(ppsim, id, Position{Predator})
end |> heatmap |> add_colorbar
````

#### Prey Positions

````@example predator
calc_raster(ppsim, :raster, Int64, [ Position{Prey} ]) do id
    num_edges(ppsim, id, Position{Prey})
end |> heatmap |> add_colorbar
````

#### Cells that contains food

````@example predator
calc_raster(ppsim, :raster, Int64, [ Cell ]) do id
    agentstate(ppsim, id, Cell).countdown == 0
end |> heatmap |> add_colorbar
````
